At least three from each evaluation criterion.\r\nclarity:\r\nTitle is not given: This graph did not occur with a title which is confusing when we try to understand the meaning and intention of the graph.\r\nMeaningless bubble colors: It is hard to distinguish exporters and importers, especially when one country have a relatively similar import and export column, for example it is hard for us to distinguish whether Japan falls in importers or Exporters. \r\n100% opacity and overlapping bubbles: when we observe the given bubble chart, we can see that some bubble are heavily overlapping and we are unable to see the white dot which indicate the location of bubble. It is because the size of bubbles is not adjusted to a easy observe size and bubbles are of 100% opacity \r\n\r\nAesthetics:\r\nThe scale of axis(for both imports and exports) is not clear and cannot correspond to the actual value since scales ticks are not clear and obvious.\r\nThe number of axis are poorly labeled, we are unable to tell the unit of currency by only look at the axis \r\nAlthough the given grapg is able to see the differnce from country to country, it is hard for us to see directly whether the actual geometry position of countries and how they influenced on the exports and imports\r\n\r\nTask 2: With reference to the critics above, suggest alternative graphical presentation to improve the current design. Sketch out the proposed design. The proposed alternative design should include appropriate interactive techniques. Support your design by describing the advantages or which part of the issue(s) your alternative design try to overcome.\r\nThe proposed design is sketched as picture below: \r\nDesign Introduction:\r\nFrom the proposed design I proposed two charts, the first one is a bubble Chart which is able to help users to find order of the total import and export volume of each country in all countries over the years(which are able to adjusted by the slider bar on the upper right), a ranking of countries is calculated using the sum of Import and Export and will be presented in the tooltip.\r\nThe second chart is also a bubble chart but from a different perspective, it is a combination of bubble chart and a map, the Net Importers and Net Exporters are also separated using different colors, the tooltip will provide details of Import and Export data, users can manually adjust the Time scale and when users click on the country they are intended to find in either chart, the corresponding bubble will be highlighted in the other chart. Trade Surplus and Trade Deficit, and the total merchandise volume are also calculated and demonstrated using Tooltip.\r\n\r\nAdvantages:\r\nFlexibility: In this design, charts are manually adjustable, given that users may choose any time slots and any of countries.\r\nClearance: Although it seems similar to the original chart, I did separate the Net Exporters and Net Importers using different color scale so we can tell clearly whether the countries are overall Net Importers or Net Exporters.\r\nAnimation visualization: using animation, slider bar and filters we are able to get better interaction between user and the graph\r\n\r\nTask 3: Using Tableau, design the proposed data visualisation.\r\n\r\nTask 4: Provide step-by-step description on how the data visualisation was prepared. (30 marks)\r\nPreparing data:\r\nOpen dataset in excel sheet\r\n\r\n2.Rename the dataset as Import and Export.\r\n\r\n3.Delete extra rows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrag the file into tableau.\r\n\r\n5.Drag Export to the upper right field and click on Use data Interpreter\r\n\r\n6.Choose the second column and slide to the end of table, press shift + click on last column to choose all intended columns, right click and choose Pivot to create a pivot chart\r\n75 \r\n\r\nFor the pivot chart, right click on first column and choose Split\r\n\r\nHide un-relative columns: Right click on column 1 and choose Hide\r\n\r\nChange column data type: Change data type by click on the “Abc” sign on top right of column. The data type will be Geographic Role->Country/Region, Date & Time, Number(decimal).\r\n\r\nRight click on column names and choose Rename, change the column names as Export Countries, Export Unit, Export Time and Export.\r\n\r\nDrag Imports to upper right field and repeat the steps of Pivot & Split & Hide irrelative columns & Change data type & Rename columns, note the new columns are named as Import countries & Import Unit & Import time & Import, the result shows as follows.\r\n\r\nClick on the link between Export and Import -> Add more field -> click on Export Time and Import Time\r\n\r\nCreate Measures variables using calculation\r\nClick on Analysis -> Create Calculated Field… to create a new Measure names Trade gap\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate another calculate field Export+Import to demonstrate the overall trade, also trade surplus and trade defict is calculated accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate Bubble Chart\r\nDrag the intended variables into destination part as is whow in the picture below\r\n\r\nAnd for the export time in the filter, we choose Relative Date after dragging in and choose Range of Dates to select date range.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter click on Apply->OK, we right click on Export Time and click on Show filter so we are able to get the slider bar which enable us to choose time range.\r\n\r\nFor the border and opacity of Bubbles, we click on color pan and choose 80% opacity, also choose which color for the bubble border\r\n\r\nClick on the triangle on SUM(Trade gap) and choose Edit Colors…, Change the setting as picture shown below.\r\n\r\nRight click on header choose Edit title…, change the title as following picture\r\n\r\nAdding ticks by right click on both axis and choose Format, choose solid balck line for Ticks under Scale and for Number change into Currency(Standard)->Singapore.\r\n\r\nAnnotate the area by right click on chart area and choose Annotate->Area, we then mark the upper left area of the chart as Net Exporters in red and lower right area as Net Importers in Blue.\r\n\r\nThe finished graph will be as following picture:\r\n\r\nAdd ranking data in Tooltip and rearrange Tooltip illustration: Calculate the Rankindata using formula below.\r\n\r\nDrag Ranking data to Tooltip, and right click on it, choose Compute Using-> Export Coutry\r\n\r\nRearange the Tooltip as the graph shown below:\r\n\r\nthe final outcome will be like:\r\n\r\nAnimations: Click on Format->Animation…, switch the Workbook Default settings on left to On and change the Duration to 2 seconds\r\n\r\nGeo\r\nDrag export country to empty space\r\n\r\nDrage Trade gap to color pan and click on the Efit color as is shown in the picture.\r\n\r\nThe color edit steps should be as following picture:\r\n\r\n3.Drag Import and Export to Tooltip pan\r\n\r\nNoted that some countries are not recognized, so we click on Map -> Edit Locations…. Can see there are some countries/regions unrecongmized, so we change them manually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nType in those countries that not recongnized by system then click on ok.\r\n\r\n5.Drag trade surplus, trade defict and Export+Import to tooltip to demonstrate the number. Edit the tooltip after dragging as given picture.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrag Export time to filter and redone the same for bubble chart.\r\n\r\nDrag Import+Export to Size pan to demonstrate the overall merchandise bubbles:\r\n\r\nThe outcome will be as following pictures, right click on ‘9 unknowns’ and choose hide to hide the nine unknown countries.\r\n\r\nEdit the praph title as following pic:\r\n\r\nCreate dashboard:\r\nIn order to choose the same time slot in the same time for both graph, we right click on the filter and choose Apply to Worksheet->Slected Worksheet.\r\n\r\nChoose Bubble and Geo Plot then click on Ok.\r\n\r\nClick on New Dashboard icon on lower right of tableau and Drag the intended plots into a newly created dashboard.\r\nClick on Show Dashboard Title and make the title of dashboard as ‘DataVis Makeover 2’\r\n\r\nRearrange the location of graphs and custom the size as following pictures:\r\n\r\nClick on use as filter to make the bubble so we can choose whichever bubble and shown in another graph\r\n\r\nSave this to tableau public:\r\nClick on Server->Tableau Public->Save to Tableau Public As…\r\n\r\nLog into tableau public.\r\n\r\nEdit the title of publich before click on Ok.\r\n\r\nTask 5 Describe three major observations revealed by the data visualisation prepared.\r\nObservation 1:\r\nFor Singapore generally the import volume is greater than export volume. We can observe from the map chart that there are obviously more blue color than red. This actually makes sense since Singapore is a city country and heavily based on foreign imports.\r\nAlso we may realize that those countries/regions which are export dominate are generally developing countries, while those have more import are developed countries.\r\n\r\nObservation 2:\r\nFor the Top 5 countries of overall merchandise ranking, we can also find out that most countries are having more exports except USA.During the last ten years, Mainland China is the country/region that have most import and export transactions with Singapore, followed by Malaysia, USA, Indonesia and Hong Kong.\r\nAlso we can recognize that for countries which have larger Imports are useually developed countries which those have larger Export are usually developing countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObservation 3:\r\nComparing to time period of 1995 to 2005, past ten years Singapore starting to have more export to more countries in the world, which indicate that in past two decades Sinapore is trying to achieve the transformation of the import-based economic development model has been very effective.\r\nIt is noticeable that with time goes by, China grow very fast in both Import and Export volume, which fit the reality that China’s economy has developed rapidly in the past two decades.\r\nAlso for USA it seems that Singapore become its Net Importer in the past two decades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

At least three from each evaluation criterion.\r\nclarity:\r\nTitle is not precise: Given the title “Merchandise Trade of Top Six Trading Countries,2019-2020”, there is no clear explanation of what does “top” means, and How the ranking is given.\r\nGiven a large amount of countries and time scale over 30 years, only 3 years data is provided in the demonstration no further demonstration can be adopted.\r\nFor Import and Export of y-axis, the scale is not same for import and export which means in the given visualization, Import Volume and Export Volume cannot be compared with each other, also, for users it add difficulties to compare the difference of import and export patern between countries.\r\n\r\nAesthetics:\r\nChart title’s font size: Font size of title should be bigger than the commentary so readers will be easily distinguish the topic of charts\r\nArea chart might not be the most appropriate demonstration method: Although area chart is ideal for demonstrating the time series of Import and Export data, it doesn’t fit people’s thinking patterns of understanding the Import and export balance.In this case a Bar chart will be more adequate.\r\nThe time scale of the x-axis(Month of Period) is not clear and cannot correspond to the actual value since scales ticks are not clear and obvious.\r\n\r\n\r\nTask 2: Alternative graphical presentation to improve the current design.\r\nThe proposed design is sketched as picture below: \r\nDesign Introduction:\r\nFrom the proposed design I proposed two charts, the first one is Pie Chart which is able to help users to find the percentage of the total import and export volume of each country in all countries over the years, a ranking of countries is calculated using the sum of Import and Export.Users are able to manually adjust time scale and select countries.\r\nThe second chart is a Bar chart provides details of Import and Export data, users can manually adjust the Time scale and countries that are intended to be compared. Trade Surplus and Trade Deficit are also calculated and demonstrated using Tooltip.\r\n\r\nAdvantages:\r\nFlexibility: In this design, charts are manually adjustable, given that users may choose any time slots and any combination of countries.\r\nEasiness to compare between countries.\r\nClear data details using Tolltip.\r\n\r\nTask 3: Data visualization designed using Tableau\r\n\r\nTask 4: Step-by-step description on data visualization preparation.\r\n4.1 Data preparation\r\nDrag the data file into tableau and drag T1 to table area  Tick Use data interpreter and choose import data from Jan 1976 to April 2021 and right click chose pivot.  Change variable names into “Year” ”Import”, and change data type of “Year” into Date; Drag T2 into data area and repeat same steps for T2, variable names are changed into “Year(T2)” and “Export”;\r\nClick on the connect line of T1 and T2, edit relation ships as picture shown: \r\nThe final outcome will be like:\r\n Calculate Trade Deficit and Trade Surplus using Analysis->Create Calculated field… \r\n4.2 Create Pie Chart\r\nIn the Marks card, select Pie from the drop down menu. Drag Export+Import Values to Size. Drag Countries Values to Color. \r\nDrag Year and Countries into Filter, right click on the Marks card and select Edit Filter  Drag a specific measure to Tooltip to the pie chart.Double click on tooltip and edit as following picture.  Edit both the Year and Countries Filters by right click on triangle on top right of the filter and set as in following picture  Edit the Font size of Chart Title by double click on title, Edit font size of filters by click on edit filter. And the outcome will be as is shown in picture followed. \r\n4.3 Create Bar Chart\r\nDrag Year to Columns, drag Countries and Import to Rows  Drag Export to the right edge of Chart \r\nChange Marks into Bars and edit y-axis by right click on it, change the Scale to fixed for both Import and Export as is shown in picture.  Drag Year and Countries into filter and change the format of Year into Month fot both Year in column and in filter.  Drag Trade Surplus and Trade Deficit into Tooltip, double click on Tooltip and edit as following picture, note that change color of Surplus to blue and Deficit to red.  Edit both the Year and Countries Filters by right click on triangle on top right of the filter and set as in following picture  Edit the Font size of Chart Title by double click on title, Edit font size of filters by click on edit filter. Change the format of x-axis into solid and black lines to enable a better and clear view.Edit in Axis-> Scale-> Ticks and as is shown in picture below.  And the outcome will be as is shown in picture followed.  ### 4.3 Create Bar Chart In order to illustrate two graph in the same time we use dashboard.Click on the dashboard and drag sheets into intended plave and re-order until satisfied. \r\nAfter satisfied click on Server->Tableau Public->Save to Tableau Public… \r\nTask 5: Major observations\r\nFor Developing countries like China and Malaysia, usually have higher Export volume than Import Volume.\r\nFor Developed countries and regions like Japan and United States, usually the Export volume lower than Import Volume.\r\nHongkong is very interesting since it have a really high Trade Surplus, there could because Hong Kong is an channel for Chinese exports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
