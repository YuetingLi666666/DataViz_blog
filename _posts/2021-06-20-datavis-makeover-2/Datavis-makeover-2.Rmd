### Explore different perspectives and approaches to design more truthful and enlightening data visualisation

![](image\Makeover.jpg)

### Task 1:	Critic the data visualisation from both its clarity and aesthetics. At least three from each evaluation criterion.
* clarity:
  * Title is not given: This graph did not occur with a title which is confusing when we try to understand the meaning and intention of the graph.
  *	Meaningless bubble colors: It is hard to distinguish exporters and importers, especially when one country have a relatively similar import and export column, for example it is hard for us to distinguish whether Japan falls in importers or Exporters.

![](image\japan.png)
  * 100% opacity and overlapping bubbles: when we observe the given bubble chart, we can see that some bubble are heavily overlapping and we are unable to see the white dot which indicate the location of bubble. It is because the size of bubbles is not adusted to a easy observe size and bubbles are of 100% opacity

![](image\overlapping.png)

* Aesthetics:
  * The scale of axis(for both imports and exports) is not clear and cannot correspond to the actual value since scales ticks are not clear and obvious.
  * The number of axis are poorly labeled, we are unable to tell the unit of currency by only look at the axis

![](image\axis.png)
  * Although the given grapg is able to see the differnce from country to country, it is hard for us to see directly whether the actual geometry position of countries and how they influenced on the exports and imports


### Task 2:	With reference to the critics above, suggest alternative graphical presentation to improve the current design. Sketch out the proposed design. The proposed alternative design should include appropriate interactive techniques. Support your design by describing the advantages or which part of the issue(s) your alternative design try to overcome.
The proposed design is sketched as picture below:

![](image\sketch.jpg)

* Design Introduction:
  * From the proposed design I proposed two charts, the first one is a bubble Chart which is able to help users to find order of the total import and export volume of each country in all countries over the years(which are able to adjusted by the slider bar on the upper right), a ranking of countries is calculated using the sum of Import and Export and will be presented in the tooltip. 

  * The second chart is also a bubble chart but from a different perspective, it is a combination of bubble chart and a map, the Net Importers and Net Exporters are also separated using different colors, the tooltip will provide details of Import and Export data, users can manually adjust the Time scale and when users click on the country they are intended to find in either chart, the corresponding bubble will be highlighted in the other chart. Trade Surplus and Trade Deficit, and the total merchandise volume are also calculated and demonstrated using Tooltip.

* Advantages:
  * Flexibility: In this design, charts are manually adjustable, given that users may choose any time slots and any of countries.
  * Clearance: Although it seems similar to the original chart, I did separate the Net Exporters and Net Importers using different color scale so we can tell clearly whether the countries are overall Net Importers or Net Exporters.
  * Animation visualization: using animation, slider bar and filters we are able to get better interaction between user and the graph


### Task 3: Using Tableau, design the proposed data visualisation.

### Task 4: Provide step-by-step description on how the data visualisation was prepared. (30 marks)
* Preparing data:
1. Open dataset in excel sheet

![](image\open1.png)

2.Rename the dataset as Import and Export.

![](image\open2.png)

3.Delete extra rows.

![](image\deleting 1.png)
![](image\deleting 2.png)
![](image\deleting 3.png)

4. Drag the file into tableau.

![](image\import1.png)

5.Drag Export to the upper right field and click on Use data Interpreter

![](image\clean1.png)

6.Choose the second column and slide to the end of table, press shift + click on last column to choose all intended columns, right click and choose Pivot to create a pivot chart

![](image\clean2.png)
![](image\clean3.png)

7. For the pivot chart, right click on first column and choose Split

![](image\clean4.png)

8. Hide un-relative columns: Right click on column 1 and choose Hide

![](image\clean5.png)

9. Change column data type: Change data type by click on the “Abc” sign on top right of column. The data type will be Geographic Role->Country/Region, Date & Time, Number(decimal).

![](image\clean6.png)

10. Right click on column names and choose Rename, change the column names as Export Countries, Export Unit, Export Time and Export.

![](image\clean7.png)

11. Drag Imports to upper right field and repeat the steps of Pivot & Split & Hide irrelative columns & Change data type & Rename columns, note the new columns are named as Import countries & Import Unit & Import time & Import, the result shows as follows.

![](image\clean8.png)

12. Click on the link between Export and Import -> Add more field -> click on Export Time and Import Time 

![](image\clean9.png)

* Create Measures variables using calculation
1. Click on Analysis -> Create Calculated Field… to create a new Measure names Trade gap

![](image\calculation1.png)
![](image\calculation2.png)

2. Create another calculate field Export+Import to demonstrate the overall trade, also trade surplus and trade defict is calculated accordingly.

![](image\calculation3.png)
![](image\calculation4.png)
![](image\calculation5.png)

* Create Bubble Chart
1. Drag the intended variables into destination part as is whow in the picture below

![](image\bubble1.png)

2. And for the export time in the filter, we choose Relative Date after dragging in and choose Range of Dates to select date range.

![](image\bubble2.png)
![](image\bubble3.png)

3. After click on Apply->OK, we right click on Export Time and click on Show filter so we are able to get the slider bar which enable us to choose time range.

![](image\bubble4.png)

4. For the border and opacity of Bubbles, we click on color pan and choose 80% opacity, also choose which color for the bubble border

![](image\bubble5.png)

5. Click on the triangle on SUM(Trade gap) and choose Edit Colors..., Change the setting as picture shown below.

![](image\bubble6.png)

6. Right click on header choose Edit title..., change the title as following picture

![](image\bubble7.png)

7. Adding ticks by right click on both axis and choose Format, choose solid balck line for Ticks under Scale and for Number change into Currency(Standard)->Singapore.

![](image\bubble8.png)

8. Annotate the area by right click on chart area and choose Annotate->Area, we then mark the upper left area of the chart as Net Exporters in red and lower right area as Net Importers in Blue.

![](image\bubble9.png)

The finished graph will be as following picture:

![](image\bubble10.png)

9. Add ranking data in Tooltip and rearrange Tooltip illustration:
Calculate the Rankindata using formula below.

![](image\bubble11.png)

Drag Ranking data to Tooltip, and right click on it, choose Compute Using-> Export Coutry

![](image\bubble12.png)

Rearange the Tooltip as the graph shown below:

![](image\bubble13.png)

the final outcome will be like:

![](image\bubble14.png)


* Animations: Click on Format->Animation..., switch the Workbook Default settings on left to On and change the Duration to 2 seconds


![](image\Animation.png)

* Geo
1. Drag export country to empty space

![](image\geo1.png)

2. Drage Trade gap to color pan and click on the Efit color as is shown in the picture.
![](image\geo2.png)

The color edit steps should be as following picture:
![](image\geo3.png)

3.Drag Import and Export to Tooltip pan

![](image\geo4.png)


4. Noted that some countries are not recognized, so we click on Map -> Edit Locations…. Can see there are some countries/regions unrecongmized, so we change them manually.

![](image\geo5.png)
![](image\geo6.png)
![](image\geo7.png)

Type in those countries that not recongnized by system then click on ok.

![](image\geo8.png)

5.Drag trade surplus, trade defict and Export+Import to tooltip to demonstrate the number. Edit the tooltip after dragging as given picture.

![](image\geo9.png)
![](image\geo10.png)

6. Drag Export time to filter and redone the same for bubble chart.
