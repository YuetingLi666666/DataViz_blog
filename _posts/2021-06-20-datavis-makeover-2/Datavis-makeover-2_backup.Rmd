### Explore different perspectives and approaches to design more truthful and enlightening data visualisation
![](image\Makeover.jpg)

### Task 1:	Critic the data visualisation from both its clarity and aesthetics. At least three from each evaluation criterion.
* clarity:
  * Title is not given: This graph did not occur with a title which is confusing when we try to understand the meaning and intention of the graph.
  *	Meaningless bubble colors: It is hard to distinguish exporters and importers, especially when one country have a relatively similar import and export column, for example it is hard for us to distinguish whether Japan falls in importers or Exporters.
  ![](image\japan.png)
  * 100% opacity and overlapping bubbles: when we observe the given bubble chart, we can see that some bubble are heavily overlapping and we are unable to see the white dot which indicate the location of bubble. It is because the size of bubbles is not adjusted to a easy observe size and bubbles are of 100% opacity

![](image\overlapping.png)
* Aesthetics:
  * The scale of axis(for both imports and exports) is not clear and cannot correspond to the actual value since scales ticks are not clear and obvious.
  * The number of axis are poorly labeled, we are unable to tell the unit of currency by only look at the axis
![](image\axis.png)
  * Although the given grapg is able to see the differnce from country to country, it is hard for us to see directly whether the actual geometry position of countries and how they influenced on the exports and imports


### Task 2:	With reference to the critics above, suggest alternative graphical presentation to improve the current design. Sketch out the proposed design. The proposed alternative design should include appropriate interactive techniques. Support your design by describing the advantages or which part of the issue(s) your alternative design try to overcome.
The proposed design is sketched as picture below:
  ![](image\sketch.jpg)

* Design Introduction:
  * From the proposed design I proposed two charts, the first one is a bubble Chart which is able to help users to find order of the total import and export volume of each country in all countries over the years(which are able to adjusted by the slider bar on the upper right), a ranking of countries is calculated using the sum of Import and Export and will be presented in the tooltip. 

  * The second chart is also a bubble chart but from a different perspective, it is a combination of bubble chart and a map, the Net Importers and Net Exporters are also separated using different colors, the tooltip will provide details of Import and Export data, users can manually adjust the Time scale and when users click on the country they are intended to find in either chart, the corresponding bubble will be highlighted in the other chart. Trade Surplus and Trade Deficit, and the total merchandise volume are also calculated and demonstrated using Tooltip.

* Advantages:
  * Flexibility: In this design, charts are manually adjustable, given that users may choose any time slots and any of countries.
  * Clearance: Although it seems similar to the original chart, I did separate the Net Exporters and Net Importers using different color scale so we can tell clearly whether the countries are overall Net Importers or Net Exporters.
  * Animation visualization: using animation, slider bar and filters we are able to get better interaction between user and the graph


### Task 3: Using Tableau, design the proposed data visualisation.

![](image\calculation2.png)


2. Create another calculate field Export+Import to demonstrate the overall trade, also trade surplus and trade defict is calculated accordingly.

![](image\calculation3.png)

![](image\calculation4.png)

![](image\calculation5.png)
 

* Create Bubble Chart

1. Drag the intended variables into destination part as is whow in the picture below

![](image\bubble1.png)
 

2. And for the export time in the filter, we choose Relative Date after dragging in and choose Range of Dates to select date range.

![](image\bubble2.png)

![](image\bubble3.png)

3. After click on Apply->OK, we right click on Export Time and click on Show filter so we are able to get the slider bar which enable us to choose time range.

![](image\bubble4.png)

4. For the border and opacity of Bubbles, we click on color pan and choose 80% opacity, also choose which color for the bubble border

![](image\bubble5.png)

5. Click on the triangle on SUM(Trade gap) and choose Edit Colors..., Change the setting as picture shown below.
 

![](image\bubble6.png)
 

6. Right click on header choose Edit title..., change the title as following picture
 

![](image\bubble7.png)


7. Adding ticks by right click on both axis and choose Format, choose solid balck line for Ticks under Scale and for Number change into Currency(Standard)->Singapore.

![](image\bubble8.png)
 

8. Annotate the area by right click on chart area and choose Annotate->Area, we then mark the upper left area of the chart as Net Exporters in red and lower right area as Net Importers in Blue.

![](image\bubble9.png)

The finished graph will be as following picture:

![](image\bubble10.png)

9. Add ranking data in Tooltip and rearrange Tooltip illustration:
Calculate the Rankindata using formula below.

![](image\bubble11.png)

Drag Ranking data to Tooltip, and right click on it, choose Compute Using-> Export Coutry

![](image\bubble12.png)

Rearange the Tooltip as the graph shown below:

### Task 5	Describe three major observations revealed by the data visualisation prepared. 

* Observation 1: 
 * For Singapore generally the import volume is greater than export volume. We can observe from the map chart that there are obviously more blue color than red. This actually makes sense since Singapore is a city country and heavily based on foreign imports. 

![](image\ob1.png)

* Observation 2:
 * For the Top 5 countries of overall merchandise ranking, we can also find out that most countries are having more exports except USA.During the last ten years, Mainland China is the country/region that have most import and export transactions with Singapore, followed by Malaysia, USA, Indonesia and Hong Kong.

 * Also we can recognize that for countries which have larger Imports are useually developed countries which those have larger Export are usually developing countries.

![](image\ob2-3.png)

![](image\ob2-5.png)

![](image\ob2-4.png)
 

* Observation 3:
 * Comparing to time period of  1995 to 2005, past ten years Singapore starting to have more export to more countries in the world, which indicate that in past two decades Sinapore is trying to achieve the transformation of the import-based economic development model has been very effective.

 * It is noticeable that with time goes by, China grow very fast in both Import and Export volume, which fit the reality that China's economy has developed rapidly in the past two decades.

 * Also for USA it seems that Singapore become its Net Importer in the past two decades.
